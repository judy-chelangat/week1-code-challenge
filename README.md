# Project Tittle: Week 1 Code Challenge
# Project Description
 I am going to work on 3 code challenges. The student Grade Generator, speed detector, and Net Salary Calculator. By applying the knowledge acquired from the coursework so far, I am  going to write programs to satisfy the expectations given in each case.

 # Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator
I  wrote a program that prompts the user to input the student marks. The input should be between zero(0) and one hundred(100) and the correct grade should be output as: Grade A > 79 Grade B > 60 to 79 Grade C > 59 to 49 Grade D > 40 to 49 Grade E > less 40

 # Challenge 2: Speed Detector
 come up with a program which takes as input the speed of a car for example 80. If the case is such that the speed is less than 70, it should print "Ok". If the case is not as stated above, it should award the driver one penalty point and print the total number of demerit points.

# Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator
 we have to write a program that would calculate the Payee Tax, NHIF, NSSF Deductions and net salary. A link is provided where we can get and use the KRA, NHIF, and NSSF values in this challenge. https://www.aren.co.ke/payroll/taxrates.htm https://www.kra.go.ke/en/individual/calculate-tax/calculating-tax/paye

 # Project Setup
After creating the repository on your Github account, we go ahead and create either a folder containing all the three files or separately creating each javascript file for each challenge. We will go ahead and create the programs in the studentgrader.js, speed_detector.js, and netsalary.js respectively.

1  Fork this repository .
2 git clone this repository .
3 cd week1-code-Challenge
4 code . to open the repository on your IDE.

For the building and running of this applications you will require to have the following;

Web browser  Google Chrome 
IDE , i.e Vscode.
Node installed preferably v14.21.3.
You can test if the files are working by running :

node filename.js
